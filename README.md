# FindLowDigAccounts
Made by Zute/Ezzpify

This will scan Steam accounts within a certain range and if they have no set up their Steam Community profile then it will log that account Steam id. I am not responsible for what you do with this.

Credits for the original idea goes to lukeryuri/phoenixdoom. They have their own project that I recommend you also check out! https://github.com/hvze/steam-gen
